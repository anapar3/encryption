# encryption
This program takes an inputted message and encrypts or decrypts it based on an inputted key.

The created GUI accepts input from the user for a message and the key by which it should be either encrypted or decrypted. The message is then either encrypted
or decrypted based on what the user selects.

The encryption and decryption is based off of ASCII characters. Each number that is part of the key is rotated through and applied to each character of the inputted
message.
